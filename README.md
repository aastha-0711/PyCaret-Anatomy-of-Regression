Anatomy of Regression with PyCaret
This repository contains a hands-on project that explores regression techniques using PyCaret, a powerful Python library for machine learning automation. The project walks through the steps of setting up a regression environment, comparing multiple regression models, fine-tuning their hyperparameters, creating ensemble models, and interpreting the results.

Key tasks include:

1. Importing and preparing data for regression analysis
2. Creating and comparing multiple regression models
3. Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance
4. Implementing stacking and ensemble techniques for improved predictive accuracy
5. Visualizing and interpreting model results using advanced tools like SHAP
